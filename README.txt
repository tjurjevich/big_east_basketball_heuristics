This project was completed for an Integer Programming semester project at University of Nebraska Omaha in Spring 2024.

The objective of this project was to use common metaheuristics/heuristics approaches, primarily tabu search via neighborhood swapping, to formulate a different Big East Men's Basketball Schedule than the one originally carried out during the 2023-2024 conference season.

Several constraints needed to be followed, making the task computationally challenging. However, roughly 15,000 miles were removed from the total team intra-conference travel distance throughout the course of the season, and the newly-formulated schedule can be found in "OptimalBESchedule.csv".
